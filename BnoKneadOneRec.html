            <h3>ADAPTED FROM A RECIPE BY PJ HAMEL</h3>
            <p><br>Yield: 1 loaf<br>
                <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons mashed banana</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>3 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
                </ul>
                <ol><strong>Instructions</strong>
                    <li>Heavily grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. This loaf tends to stick, so be sure to grease the pan thoroughly with non-stick vegetable oil spray.</li>
                    <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.</li>
                    <li>Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl. Beat the mixture vigorously for about 6 to 8 minutes; an electric mixer set on slow to medium speed works well here. You should have a very sticky dough. It won't be pourable, but neither will it be kneadable. Scoop it into the prepared pan. Wet your fingers, and smooth out the top of the dough.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pan with lightly greased plastic wrap. Let the loaf rise for 60 to 90 minutes; it should just about rise to the rim of the pan, perhaps just barely cresting over the rim. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                    <li>Uncover the bread, and bake it for 40 to 45 minutes, tenting it with aluminum foil after 20 minutes. The bread is done when it's golden brown on top, and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers between 190°F and 195°F.</li>
                    <li>Remove the bread from the oven, and after 5 minutes turn it out onto a rack. Brush with melted butter, if desired; this will keep the crust soft. Cool the bread completely before cutting it.</li>
                    <li>Store the bread, tightly wrapped in plastic, at cool room temperature for 2 to 3 days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
                </ol>        
                <ul><strong>Tips from our Bakers</strong>
                    <li>For best results, use an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. If you use a 9" x 5" pan (measure the inside/top dimensions, to see what size you have), your loaf will turn out shorter and flatter.</li>
                </ul>
