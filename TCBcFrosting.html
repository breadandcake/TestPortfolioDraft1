            <h3>RECIPE BY CHARLOTTE RUTLEDGE<br>from King Arthur Baking Company</h3>
            <p>
                <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups (106g) natural cocoa powder*</li>
                    <li>4 cups (454g) confectioners' sugar, divided</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup (74g) water, hot</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon (14g) King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
                    <li>20 tablespoons (284g) butter, softened</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">*Substitute Dutch-process cocoa if you like; the frosting will have a more robust, bittersweet chocolate flavor.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <ol><strong>Instructions</strong>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together — by hand or mixer — the cocoa powder, 1 cup (113g) of the confectioners' sugar, and the salt. Stir in the water and vanilla, scraping the bowl if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Add the butter and remaining confectioners' sugar, stirring to combine. Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the frosting at medium-high speed for 1 to 2 minutes, until lightened in color and fluffy, stopping halfway through to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. When the frosting is ready, scoop out a bit on your spatula; does it seem nicely spreadable? If it's too stiff, beat in water (1 teaspoon at a time) until it's the consistency you want.</li>
                </ol>        
                <ul><strong>Tips from our Bakers</strong>
                    <li>Make ahead tips: Cake layers and frosting can be made up to three days ahead, refrigerated, and the cake assembled the day you wish to serve it. For storing, wrap the layers in plastic and transfer the frosting to an airtight container, or tightly cover the bowl in which you made it. When you're ready to assemble the cake, remove the frosting from the fridge and warm at room temperature until soft enough to spread easily. The whole cake (assembled and decorated) can be stored in the freezer for up to a month.</li>
                    <li>To make a 9" x 13" sheet cake: Prepare the batter as directed. Pour it into a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan, and bake in a preheated 325°F oven for about 45 to 48 minutes, until the cake tests done. You'll have excess frosting if you make the entire frosting recipe; if you don't want to end up with leftover frosting, consider making a half recipe (which will frost the cake minimally), or a three-quarter recipe (which will frost it more generously).</li>
