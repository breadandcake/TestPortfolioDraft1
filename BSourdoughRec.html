            <h2>Clay's Multigrain Sourdough Sandwich Bread</h2>
            <h3>RECIPE BY CLAY BLACKWELL<br>from King Arthur Baking Company</h3>
            <p><br>Yield: 1 loaf<br>
                <!--<ul style="list-style-type: none;">Yield: 1 loaf</ul>-->
                <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
                    <li>2/3 cup (156g) sourdough starter, ripe (fed) or discard</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup (152g) lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon (14g) olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon (14g) granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons (8g) salt</li>
                    <li>1 1/3 to 1 1/2 cups (160g to 180g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup (43g) potato flour or 1/2 cup (43g) dried potato flakes (instant mashed potatoes)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (57g) King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons King Arthur Whole Grain Bread Improver, optional, but helpful for rise</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup (50g) King Arthur Harvest Grains Blend, or your favorite blend of seeds and flaked whole grains</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
                </ul>
                <ol><strong>Instructions</strong>
                    <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.</li>
                    <li>Combine all of the ingredients — in a bowl, the bowl of an electric mixer, or the pan of your bread machine — and mix and knead to form a smooth dough. The dough may start out shaggy, then become stickier as you knead; if you use a stand mixer, by the end of a 7-minute knead it'll be sticking heavily to the sides of the bowl. That's OK; if you can scrape it off the sides of the bowl and it feels firm enough to hold its shape, and doesn't stick to your floured or oiled hands, it's fine.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough, and allow it to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours; it'll become puffy, though it may not double in bulk.</li>
                    <li>Lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan. Gently deflate the risen dough, and shape it into a log. Place it in the pan, cover it lightly, and allow it to rise until it crests at least 1" over the rim of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The bread doesn't have much oven-spring (i.e., it won't rise much once it's in the oven), so be sure to let it rise fully before baking. A loaf risen 1" over the rim of the pan will be denser and more close-grained; letting it rise higher will give you a "spongier," lighter bread. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                    <li>Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes, tenting it with foil after 20 minutes if it's as brown as you like it. When it's done, the bread will be golden brown, and will register 190°F on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center.</li>
                    <li>Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack, to cool completely.</li>
                </ol>        
                <ul><strong>Tips from our Bakers</strong>
                    <li>Since sourdough starters vary quite a bit in consistency, from thin as popover batter to thick as soft dough, it's difficult to give an exact amount of flour. If your starter is very thin, you may need an additional 2 to 4 tablespoons of flour, beyond the 1 1/2 cups, to make a dough that's sticky, yet still stiff enough to hold its shape.</li>
                    <li>If you find you haven't left yourself enough time to complete this bread on schedule, shape and place in a loaf pan; cover the pan, and refrigerate overnight, or for up to 18 hours. The bread will rise slowly in the fridge. Next day, let the loaf rest at room temperature for a couple of hours, or till it's as risen as you like; then bake as directed.</li>
                    <li>Doesn't sourdough starter need to be fed before using? Well, not necessarily. So long as you're using a recipe with added yeast, you can use sourdough straight from the fridge; just assume your rising times will be slightly longer. One caveat: if your sourdough hasn't been fed in a long time — e.g., it has a layer of dark liquid on top — best to feed it before using.</li>
